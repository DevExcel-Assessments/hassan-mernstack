## What You'll Need

Before we start, make sure you have:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** running locally or a MongoDB Atlas account
- **FFmpeg** installed (for video compression)

## Let's Get Started! ðŸŽ¯

### Step 1: Clone & Navigate
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/DevExcel-Assessments/hassan-mernstack>
cd hassan-mernstack
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

#### For the Server (Backend)
Create a file called `.env` in the `server` folder:

```env
PORT=4000
(Same as to .env.example )
And also can use the local mongodb
```

#### For the Client (Frontend)
Create a file called `.env` in the `client` folder:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
VITE_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Open two terminal windows and run:

**Terminal 1 (Server):**
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

**Terminal 2 (Client):**
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start the Application

**Terminal 1 (Server):**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
âœ… Server will be running at `http://localhost:4000`

**Terminal 2 (Client):**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev

# ðŸ“‹ Decision Log - Hassan MERN Stack Assessment Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
A comprehensive MERN stack course platform with video streaming, payment integration, user authentication, and review system.

## ðŸ”§ Problems Solved

### 1. **Video Streaming Issues**
**Problem**: Videos not playing for enrolled users
- **Root Cause**: CORS headers missing from video streaming responses
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive CORS headers to both `streamVideo.js` and `streamVideoCompressed.js`
- **Result**: Videos now stream properly with proper cross-origin handling


### 2. **Payment Flow Issues**
**Problem**: Stripe Checkout image URL rejection and blank pages after payment
- **Root Cause**: Invalid image URLs and missing redirect handling
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed image URL validation in Stripe Checkout
  - Added missing `paymentIntentId` to orders
  - Created dedicated PaymentConfirmation page
- **Result**: Smooth payment flow with proper confirmation




### 3. **Video Compression System**
**Problem**: No video compression for better streaming performance,and if try to compress it didnt play 
- **Root Cause**: Original videos were too large for efficient streaming and compression causing errors
- **Solution**: Implemented FFmpeg-based video compression with multiple quality presets but directly stream the vidoe
- **Result**: Faster video loading and better user experience
